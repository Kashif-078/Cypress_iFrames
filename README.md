**Handling iFrames in Cypress**
Welcome to the "Handle iFrames in Cypress" repository! This repository focuses on effectively managing interactions with iframes in Cypress tests. Iframes can present unique challenges in test automation, but with Cypress, you can navigate them seamlessly to ensure robust and reliable tests.

**Overview**
In this repository, we explore various methods for interacting with iframes, specifically focusing on uploading files within iframes. We demonstrate three different approaches:

**Prerequisites**
Before getting started, ensure you have installed the 'cypress-file-upload' plugin. You can install it using the following command:

**Upload Files - Using Different Approaches**
This context explores the methods mentioned above for adding files within iframes. Each approach is demonstrated with practical examples to illustrate its implementation and effectiveness.

**Directly Accessing Elements:** Accessing elements within iframes directly to upload files.
**Using Helpers:** Utilizing helper functions for streamlined interactions with iframes.
**Using Custom Commands:** Leveraging custom Cypress commands for enhanced readability and reusability.
Each approach offers distinct strategies for handling iframe interactions and file attachments, providing flexibility and adaptability to different testing scenarios.
